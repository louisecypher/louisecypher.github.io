# About this

I like writing *with things* and *about things*. These are my personal notes, rambles, analysis, *stuff* about what I write, what I read, what I use.

Mostly, this is about using AI. Generative AI. Text, Image and whatever I feel like using at the moment. I enjoy playing the game, testing these things to the limit and in the process, getting something *pretty* out of it.
